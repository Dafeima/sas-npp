# SAS language definitions for Notepad++

This (sas_notepad_udl.xml) is ready for import into Notepad++.  To use, download the XML file, then select Language->Define your language... in Notepad++.  Use the Import button to import the SAS language definition.

It's based on the commonly shared file from the 
[Notepad++ Wiki](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/User_Defined_Language_Files), but with the addition of many more keywords, functions, and PROC names that are part of the SAS language.
